ApiHandler
==========
Modified: 2021-05

This module is responsible for sending our various request types to our API and raising appropriate
exceptions that result from these requests. All outgoing raises are base exceptions of type:
ConnectionError, TimeoutError, and KeyError. Exceptions raised within this module are from the
requests.exceptions library.

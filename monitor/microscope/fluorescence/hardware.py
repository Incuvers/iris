    Some new boards (ICB 2.3 and higher) have a logic inverter chip.
    This means we need to invert the ACTIVE_HIGH boolean between these boards
    and the former once.
    This class reads from hardware.env file (read at at init), and flips the
    boolean depending on the precence of the inverter. The legacy case
    (without a hardware definition) uses no inverter and ACTIVE_HIGH=True.
